*TheIndieGameEngine* is an engine designed entirely from the ground up, able to run natively across all platforms. The engine aims to encourage innovation in the field of graphical software and games. 


I am currently working on the next iteration of this engine named *HawkEngine* and hope to release in late 2022.
