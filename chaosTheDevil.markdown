# A new retro 3D platformer
Chaos the Devil is a 3D platformer currently in development which aims to capture PS1 golden day aesthtics and mechanics. Heavily inspired by titles such as Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon, Chaos the Devil embraces old gaming paradigms, graphics techniques, and limitations of the 90s to offer a whole new adventure!
