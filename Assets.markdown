Though my qualification lie in software development, with a strong focus on gaming, I have developed my artistic skills in order to explore certain technologies and techniques as a solo developer. I have now many years experience with art packages such as Blender which allows me to create very quick and appealing prototypes, a skill which has been invaluable in my creation for both indie and AAA development.

I decided to start to release some of the assets I had used for various experiments on the Unity store, more will follow.
