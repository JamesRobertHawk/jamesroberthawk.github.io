<p>One way or another you have found yourself on my website.</p>

<p><strong>Congratulations!</strong></p>

<p>I really hope you are interested in game development, because if not these pages may be quite a chore for you.</p>

<h2 id="who-are-you">Who are you?</h2>
<p>I am James, a professional game developer traditionally educated as a software engineer, but with an interest in art asset creation too. Yep, both, odd.</p>

<h2 id="what-can-i-find-here">What can I find here?</h2>
<p>On this site you will find info on all the projects I have or am currently working on. <strong>Spoiler alert</strong> itâ€™s all games related.</p>
