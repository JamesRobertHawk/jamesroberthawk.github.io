I"Ÿ<p>Though my qualification lie in software development, with a strong focus on gaming, I have developed my artistic skills in order to explore certain technologies and techniques as a solo developer. I have now many years experience with art packages such as Blender which allows me to create very quick and appealing prototypes, a skill which has been crucial in my creation in both indie and AAA development.</p>
