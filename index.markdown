# Hello there!

One way or another you have found yourself on my website.

**Congratulations!**

I really hope you are interested in game development, because if not these pages may be quite a chore for you.

## Who are you?
I am James, a professional game developer traditionally educated as a software engineer, but with an interest in art asset creation too. Yep, both, odd.

## What can I find here?
On this site you will find info on all the projects I have or am currently working on. **Spoiler alert** it's all games related.
